<h1 class="resize-h2">Jobs for Hackers &amp; other Superheros.</h1>

<p>This isn't your average job board.  It's a collection of gigs that will make your inner nerd giddy and leave you wondering why you ever settled for an average nine-to-fiver.  Nothing unpaid.  No recruiter spam.  Just gigs that I would have wanted to have myself.</p>
