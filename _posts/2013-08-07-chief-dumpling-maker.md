Create the next, greatest, and most innovative mobile dumpling infrastructure
known to mankind.  Well, really we are just talking about building the core
infrastructure to run a food tour business.  There are no rules, little
guidance, and the head dumpling man is bipolar.  However, what you do get is
total control to build something awesome that no one (and we checked) is doing
today.

You choose the tools, the languages (if I catch you using Go though,
you may get flogged), the testing methods, the team... pretty much the whole
thing.  Really the only real requirements is that you are not an asshat, you
love to code, and the thought of dumplings makes you excited.

### About Dumplr

Dumplr is all about fun food tours and an insatiable love of dumplings. We
lead groups big and small on a culinary exploration of China as we wind
through the historic streets of the many Chinatowns of NYC. Most of our tours
are walking tours, but we do specialized tours on occasion focusing on a
particular regional cuisine or a particular area of NYC.

Dumplr was founded by NYC tech investor & entrepreneur [Mark Birch](https://twitter.com/marksbirch).
