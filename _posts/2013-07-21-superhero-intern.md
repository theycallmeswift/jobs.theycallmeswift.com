title: Superhero Intern
company: Swift
location: New York
type: Internship
---

I'm looking for an NYC based intern to help me out a few days each week.  If
you're more comfortable with a superhero metaphor, I'm looking for a sidekick
to help me kick ass and to have my back when I need it.  You'll be helping me build,
test, and scale all the crazy things that I work on every day.  This job doesn't
require you to be a programmer, but you better know what a hackathon is and be able to
navigate the hacker community easily.

If you want to be an evangelist one day, this job will provide the best
training you could possibly ever ask for (so you should definitely apply).

### Responsibilities

Your responsibilities will vary from week to week depending on what project
we're working on.  Some things you *might* find yourself doing could be:

 - Minor event coordination & planning.
 - Customer validation research.
 - Developer / Community outreach and on-boarding.
 - Writing engaging content.
 - Ideation and prototyping.
 - Fighting crime (*just kidding*).

### Requirements

 - Have a proven track record of building awesome stuff.
 - Live in NYC area or be able to commute in once a week.
 - Be able to write a coherent email / blog post.
 - Ability to manage your time and prioritize work skillfully.
 - Fast learner and self-starter.
 - Some sort of technical background or strong interest (developer, designer, etc).
