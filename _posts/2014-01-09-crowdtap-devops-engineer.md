*Back in 2011 & 2012, I actually had the pleasure of working at Crowdtap as an 
engineer.  They truly have assembled one of the finest engineering teams
around and have one of the best work environments you could ask for.  I
learned a lot during my time there and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This gig 
comes with my highest recommendations.*

Crowdtap, the leading social influence marketing platform, is looking to add
talent to our rapidly growing team. In 2013 Crowdtap was named the #3 Best
Place to Work in New York by Crain’s New York Business as well as one of the
Top 100 Most Promising Companies by Forbes. Crowdtap’s recognition, growth and
blue chip customers and investors make it among New York’s hottest and most
promising startups.

Crowdtap’s SaaS platform enables brand marketers to influence the social
conversation by helping them engage and motivate their brand advocates and
influencers, driving unmatched social activity at scale. The company works
with many of the country’s leading marketers including Verizon, Proctor and
Gamble, Nestle, Kraft, Campbell’s, AT&T and Sony to name a few.

We're doing some really cool things for a fast growing (nearly profitable), VC
backed, business that was recently named one of Forbes's 100 most promising
companies. Our stack is Ruby, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Node and Redis. We practice
continuous deployment (deploying to production multiple times a day). We also
are very proud of [our open-source contributions](http://crowdtap.github.io/).

You will be the working on the Infrastructure team who support all development
and production environments at Crowdtap. This is the perfect job if you love
automating everything by writing code to make your life easier and if you love
constantly investigating and deploying new technologies to meet the needs of a
fast scaling product.

### Skills & Requirements

**Passion**: You must love being on the command line and creating tools to
automate and simplify your and the team’s lives.

**Ability to Learn quickly**: We run Ruby, NodeJS, Java (only a little),
MongoDB/TokuMX, ElasticSearch and Redis, all hosted by Amazon AWS. If a
project requires a new technology, you will be required to understand how to
run it in a production environment as well as write the scripts (we use Chef)
to get it deployed to production. You’ll be the front-line for monitoring the
production environment, ensuring that everything is set up correctly to
auto-scale and fail-over without any impact to the user experience. Come
prepared to learn new skills and technologies at a rapid pace.

**Be family**: Everyone on the team enjoys be around each other. We have lunch
with each other, we go out for drinks every now and again and we love
celebrating successes together. Whoever joins the team needs to fit in.
