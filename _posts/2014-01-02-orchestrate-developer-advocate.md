The person in this role *must* be hyper critical of what it takes to make a
good developer experience and then have the talent and ambition to make what's
wrong, right. 

The Developer Advocate will want to write API documentation,
make it look good, and usable. This role should be vocal and opinionated in
(and about) the developer community. Writing blog and social posts should be
like breathing. Creating content means writing code or benchmarks and getting
it out in front of people to talk about it.  Responding to conference call for
speakers is fun and exciting. Hopping on a plane for a conference to be a
social butterfly (not a booth worker), should not deter this person. 

### Responsibilities

 - Writing and maintaining API documentation (and the tools to build it)
 - Write blog posts with technical content (code, benchmarks, programming or data-oriented details)
 - Maintain social presence - virtually and IRL
 - Propose speaking engagements to conferences and events
 - Work cross functionally with the executives, marketing team, and engineering team

### Requirements

 - Experience documenting APIs using common, open source tools like (Carte, Swagger, Sphinx, Apiary, Javadoc, Jersey, Jekyll, Nanoc, Middleman, etc)
 - Experience creating technical content such as code samples and benchmarks for blogs
 - Experience speaking at technical conferences
 - Fluent in reading and writing HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
 - Fluent in reading Java
 - Passion for developer experience and the programming community

### Preferred

 - Klout score greater than 50
 - Experience with various NoSQL databases
 - Fluent in numerous programming languages

### About Orchestrate

Orchestrate.io is a new API service that eliminates the need to deploy and
scale databases when building applications, or adding new features to existing
applications. It unifies all the queries needed to build interactive
applications, allowing developers to rapidly add geospatial, full-text search,
graph, and time-series based features to their apps.

By distributing data across cloud providers all around the world, public or
private, Orchestrate.io eliminates downtime during outages, reduces latency
and automatically scales to meet demand.  It’s not a new database – it’s all
of the best databases orchestrated by a single, intuitive REST API.
